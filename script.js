const message = `Happy Motherâ€™s Day, Mama! ðŸŒ¸
Thank you for everything youâ€™ve done for me over the past 13 years. Youâ€™re not just my mother, youâ€™re my role model, my teacher, and my biggest supporter. Iâ€™ve learned so much from you, and I canâ€™t imagine where Iâ€™d be without your guidance. 

I know we argue from time to time, but through it all, you never stop caring about me or my sister. Your love is unconditional, and I see it every day in the small things you do, from making sure weâ€™re always taken care of, to helping us find a way through tough situations. 

When life feels hard and the problems seem endless, you always find a way to fix them. No matter the challenge, youâ€™ve been the person that made a way for us to get through those challenges. We are so lucky to have you. Iâ€™m constantly amazed by your strength, patience, and ability to handle everything with such grace.

I know that Iâ€™m not perfect. I donâ€™t always do well with my studies, and Iâ€™m not always the best son I know I could be. But i know that Iâ€™m trying, and Iâ€™ll keep trying. I want to be better for you, and I want to make you proud. I promise that I will give my best to make sure that i can give you the life that you've been dreaming of.

Mama, youâ€™re the best mother in the world, and Iâ€™ll never be able to express how thankful I am for you. Thank you for being there for us, for loving us unconditionally, and for making this family what it is. I will always cherish everything you do for me, and Iâ€™ll never stop trying to make you happy.

Happy Motherâ€™s Day!** ðŸ’– Youâ€™re truly the best mom anyone could ever ask for, and I love you more than words could ever say!`;
